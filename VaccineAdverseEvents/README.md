# **Behind the Shots: Exploring Vaccine Adverse Events with Data**

Ever wonder what vaccine adverse event data can tell us about safety trends and outcomes? Using the CDC WONDER database, I built a Power BI dashboard to break down years of vaccine-related reports into clear, actionable insights.  

This README takes you behind the scenes to show how it all came togetherâ€”from raw data to polished visualsâ€”and what the numbers are saying.

## **The Big Picture**

The goal of this project was simple: **make sense of vaccine adverse event data from 2019 to 2024**. I wanted to uncover patterns across:  
- **Demographics**: Age and gender.  
- **Manufacturers**: Which companies had the most reports.  
- **Event Categories**: Hospitalizations, deaths, emergency visits, etc.  

### **Highlights of the Dashboard**  
1. **Top states** with the highest number of adverse events.  
2. **Manufacturers** with the most reported events.  
3. **Year-over-year trends** across event categories.  

These insights can help public health experts and vaccine makers improve safety and communication efforts.  


## **How I Made It Happen**

### 1. **Starting with the Data**  
I pulled data from the **CDC WONDER database**, which is an incredible (and free!) resource for public health info. Hereâ€™s what I did:  
- Filtered the dataset by gender:  
  - One for **male reports**.  
  - Another for **female reports**.  
- Downloaded each dataset as a text file.

### 2. **Prepping the Data**  
Next, I turned to Excelâ€™s **Power Query** tool to clean and combine the data:  
- Imported the male and female datasets into separate tables.  
- Added a column to label gender in each table.  
- Created a static column for the country (all reports are from the U.S.).  
- Appended the male and female datasets into a single table.  
- Saved the final dataset as an [Excel file](https://github.com/guilzee/PowerBIMagic/blob/main/VaccineAdverseEvents/VAERS%20Data.xlsx) for use in Power BI.  

### 3. **Building the Dashboard**  
With the data ready, I used Power BI to create the visuals:  
- **Map Visualization**: Highlighted the top 10 states with the highest adverse event counts.  
- **Bar and Column Charts**:  
  - Event counts by year (2019â€“2024).  
  - Event counts by manufacturer.  
- **Data Table**: A detailed breakdown of event categories and their counts.  

The dashboard is fully **interactive**â€”users can filter by demographics, years, and event types to explore the data from multiple angles.  


## **What the Numbers Are Saying**

1. **Emergency Care Dominates**  
Most reports (513!) were about **emergency room or office visits**. These events were urgent but not always life-threatening, making this category the largest.  

2. **Merck & Co., Inc. Leads the Manufacturer List**  
With **157 adverse events reported**, Merck had the highest count. This might reflect their vaccine usage volume rather than higher risk.  

3. **2019 Stands Out**  
Over half (**52.57%**) of all reports came from **2019**. This could indicate a major vaccination campaign or changes in reporting practices.  

4. **California Leads the States**  
Among the top 10 states, **California** had the highest number of adverse events (**37**), followed by **Florida (33)** and **Ohio (30)**.  


## **Why This Matters**

Projects like this are about more than just numbersâ€”theyâ€™re about making smarter, data-driven decisions.  

### Public health experts can use this dashboard to:  
- **Investigate trends** in high-reporting states.  
- **Analyze manufacturers** with higher report counts.  
- **Reassure the public** by showing that most events are non-severe.  


## **The Takeaway**

This project turns complex vaccine data into clear, actionable insights. Whether youâ€™re tracking trends, identifying areas for improvement, or communicating findings to stakeholders, this dashboard bridges the gap between raw data and meaningful stories.
